# Day 01 Practicals - Java Fundamentals for Spring Boot 🚀

## Overview 📘
The Day 01 practicals are designed to strengthen core Java programming skills, which are essential for understanding and working with Spring Boot. These exercises focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, problem-solving, and Java syntax.

## Topics Covered 📝
1. **Basic Java Syntax**:
   -  Input and output handling using `Scanner`.
   -  Loops (`for`, `while`) and conditional statements (`if`, `else`).

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - 🔒 **Encapsulation**: Using private fields and public getters/setters.
   - 🧬 **Inheritance**: Creating class hierarchies to reuse and extend functionality.
   - 🎭 **Polymorphism**: Overriding methods to provide specific implementations.
   - 🏗️ **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes to define common behavior.

3. **Data Structures**:
   -  Arrays for storing and manipulating data.

## Practical Exercises 💡
1. **Reversing a Sequence**:
   - Demonstrates the use of loops and arrays to manipulate data.
   - Focuses on logical thinking and algorithm design.

2. **Library System**:
   - Implements OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.
   - Models real-world entities (e.g., books) in a programmatic way.

3. **Retail Store**:
   - Demonstrates encapsulation and abstraction.
   - Uses arrays to store and display product details.

## Purpose 🎯
These exercises serve as a foundation for:
-  Understanding the principles of OOP, which are heavily used in Spring Boot.
-  Writing clean, modular, and reusable code.
-  Preparing for more advanced topics like dependency injection, REST APIs, and database integration in Spring Boot.
